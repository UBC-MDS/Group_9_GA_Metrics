# dscigametrics

Computing Google Analytics Metrics!

## Where this package fits in

The popularity and influence of Google Analytics means that there is already a decent number of related python packages, such as foofleanalytics, which can be found on PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/googleanalytics/]. However the majority of these packages provide functionality that allows developers to interact with the Google Analytics API, which presupposes a fairly high level of technical skill. Our package is intended to help users with a novice familiarity with python by operating directly on downloaded GA data sets instead.

## Installation

$ pip install dscigametrics
