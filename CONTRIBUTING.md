## Contributions from Internal Contributors

As a core team member, you play a vital role in the development and maintenance of the project. Here are some guidelines specifically for you:

1. **Division of Labor**:
    - Each team member is assigned specific tasks. Tasks are assigned to team members based on the estimated workload of each task to ensure a fair and balanced distribution of responsibilities.
    - Tasks include the development of main functions, writing tests, updating documentation, and maintenance work.

2. **Rotating Project Management**:
    - We use the GitHub Project Board for project management. This includes task assignments, tracking progress, and managing deadlines.
    - Each team member takes a turn at being the project manager for a week.
    - The project manager is responsible for overseeing the week's progress, ensuring that deadlines are met, and assisting team members as needed.

3. **Collaboration and Peer Review**:
    - Regular code reviews and team meetings are held to ensure quality and consistency.
    - Team members are encouraged to collaborate and support each other, especially in areas requiring specific expertise.

4. **Best Practices**: Adhere to our established coding standards and best practices. Ensure that your code is well-documented and tested.
